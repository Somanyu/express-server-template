# Node.js and Express.js Server

This repository provides a basic folder structure and setup for building a server using Node.js and Express.js. It includes commonly used components such as routes, controllers, models, services, middleware, and more.

## Folder Structure

The recommended folder structure for the server application is as follows:
```
├── models/
├── controllers/
├── routes/
├── services/
├── node_modules/
├── middleware/
├── utils/
├── index.js
├── package.json
├── README.md
├── .env
└── .gitignore
```
- `models/`: Contains the data models or schemas for your application.
- `controllers/`: Handles the request-response cycle, validates requests, interacts with services/models, and constructs responses.
- `routes/`: Defines the API endpoints and maps them to corresponding controller functions.
- `services/`: Implements the application's business logic and core functionality.
- `middleware/`: Contains middleware functions that intercept and process requests before reaching the controllers.
- `utils/`: Contains utility functions or helper modules.
- `index.js`: The entry point of the server application.
- `package.json`: Manages the project dependencies and scripts.
- `.env`: Stores environment variables, such as database connection details, API keys, etc.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies files and folders that should be ignored by Git.

## Installation

To set up the server, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Somanyu/express-server-template`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd express-server-template`
3. Install the dependencies: `npm install`

## Configuration

Before running the server, make sure to configure the necessary environment variables in the `.env` file. Some common variables include:

- `PORT`: The port on which the server should run.
- `MONGODB_URI`: The MongoDB connection URI.

## Starting the Server

To start the server, run the following command:
`npm start`


This will start the server using the `index.js` file as the entry point.

## Additional Information

- Node.js and Express.js are used for building the server.
- MongoDB is used as the database, with the Mongoose package for object modeling.
- Nodemon is used for automatic server restarts during development.
- The `.gitignore` file is included to exclude sensitive or unnecessary files from version control.

Feel free to modify and expand upon this basic structure according to the requirements of your specific project.
